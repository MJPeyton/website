  <h2>I drafted, designed, and implemented a drip email campaign to increase yield at various points in the admissions process.</h2>

              <h3>Results</h3>
              <p>These complex drip email programs increased conversion rates at every step of the sales funnel and resulted in over 43% growth in one program.</p>

              <h3>Flows</h3>
              <p>Each email drip flow came from analyzing three years of data. We primarily relied on incoming and exiting student surveys, as well as interviews and web analytics. We were able to target six distinct audience segments with seperate flows determined by their progress through the sales funnel.</p>

              <h3>Email Design</h3>
              <p>The design of each email followed Northwestern brand standards and focused portraying a professional yet inviting feel while following industry best practices. After some time, centralized offices at Northwestern adopted my design.</p>
